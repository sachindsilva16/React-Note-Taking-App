<h3>To follow this session tutorial, you will need the following requirements:</h3>
</summary>
</details>

- Firstly, make sure you have installed the latest version of Node.js on your computer. **[Download from here](https://nodejs.org/en)**

## ` # Step 1 `

- In this step, you'll be creating a new react application using npm package manager to run a remote script. The script will copy the neccessary files into a new directory and will install all dependencies.To know about how to use Nodejs modules with npm and package.json, **[Visit this site](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_npm.asp)**.

- Once you're done with the above setup,follow this very next step **carefully**.

> **Note** : Make sure that you are in os directory. For Windows user --> change directory to 'C:\ ' 

<br>

- To install the base project, copy and run the following command:


``` 
npx create-react-app to-do-list-app
```
> This command wil kick off a build process that will download the base code along with a # of dependencies.

- When the process finishes you will see a success message, that says : 


![Output cmd](https://github.com/sachindsilva16/Reactjs-Workshop/blob/main/Images/output-cmd1.png)

- Now your project has been setup in a new directory.Copy the following command to change into new directory.

```
cd to-do-list-app
```
> You're now inside the root of your created project.At this point, you've created a new project and added all of the dependencies. But you haven't take any of actions to run the project.
> You'll run the custom scripts to build and test the project.

<br>

## ` # Step 2 `

- Copy and run the following command:

```
npm install react react-dom react-scripts
```
> **Note** This could take some time depending upon your network-connection speed.

- Once the above scripts have been successfully processed,you'll start the project on a live server

## ` # Step 3 `

- **Start the Project** by running the following command in the root of your project.For this, your root project is **to-do-list-app** directory. Be sure to open this in a seperate terminal or tab, since this script will continue running as long as you self-terminate it.

```
npm start
```
> You might this as a output:

![Alt npm-start-output](https://github.com/sachindsilva16/Reactjs-Workshop/blob/main/Images/npm-start-output.png)

- If you're running the script locally, it will open the project in your default browser window and shifts the focus from the terminal to the browser.

- If that doesn't happen, you can visit the following site **Copy the following clipboard** to see the site action.

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

> **Warning**: Do not try to make any default changes in package.json until then or else you might get cluttered.

- In the browser, you'll see the following React Template Project running on localhost:

<img align="center" src="https://github.com/sachindsilva16/Reactjs-Workshop/blob/main/Images/default-react-app.png" width="100%" height="70%">

- **To terminate this running server**, on your existing terminal, press **`ctrl+c`** or **`ctrl+z`** on your keyboard.


## ` # Step 4 `

- Now you have successfully developed a local environment for your React-Application. You're now good to go to **code**.....

**Rest of changes will be discussed during the live-demo session...**
